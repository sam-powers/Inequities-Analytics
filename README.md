# Who is Left Behind? Investigating Increasing Disparities in Response to the Sustainable Development Goals

Formulated in 2015, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are the United Nations’ blueprint to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development in economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Integral to the UN’s declaration is the commitment to leave no one behind. To this end, the UN proposed 100 Global Monitoring Indicators with 169 statistical targets to create a harmonized monitoring and evaluation framework to create national report cards on progress toward the goals. Indicators were designed to be simple, single-variables that allow for regular longitudinal calculation, are universally applicable true in various country settings, and can be disaggregated to ensure equitable progress among demographic groups.

However, disaggregation is not centered in many current evaluation frameworks. The Sustainable Development Goals Report, for example, did not provide data on marginalized groups for key goals such as achieving Universal Health Coverage and increasing access to clean water and improved sanitation. Furthermore, at the country level, over 80% of UN 2019 profiles do not mention gaps in goal achievement between demographic groups or acknowledge country progress toward reducing disparities beyond using the Gini Coefficient to describe income inequality for SDG 10. The exceptions to this generalization include thirty-six high income countries who also report a few more dimensions including gaps in self-reported health by income, gaps in internet access by income, gender wage gap, and elderly poverty ratio. These statistics, or equivalent metrics, are not calculated for LMICs despite many national data structures such as the pervasive demographic and health surveys containing sufficient granularity to construct similar indices.

Purely aggregate evaluation stands contrary to the mission of leaving no one behind. As review of progress from the Millennium Development goals reveals, it is possible aggregate country-level improvement can occur while intra-country disparities in goal achievement widen or stall. In short, it is important for countries and for the UN to measure what they value. This requires using disaggregated data to create national programs of action for health equity that track the progress of disadvantaged groups and chart strategies toward preventing them from being left behind.

# Files

## Compiling Data
This file reads in all relavent data from the National Institute of Statistics, cleans it, and combines it into usable data sets. I am not licensed to republish it here but it can be found by contacting http://www.statistics.gov.rw/

## Running Calculations
This set begins featurization, operationaling aspects of the data into the monitoring SDG targets. 

## Preparation of P-Values
Statistically analyzing socioeconomic differences in goal achievement to quantify degree of disparities

## Analyzing Results
Calculating disparity increases and decreases at the district level between 2014 and 2017. Beginning to develop visualization framework.

## National Calculations
Conducting disparity analysis at the national level to contextualize district-level results

## Clustering for the Goals
Development of household level SDG indicator and clusering into five quintiles to spotlight those at risk of being left behind in the next 10 years.
